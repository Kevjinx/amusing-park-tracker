h1 Oh no, page not found, but here's a poem I wrote just for you ;)

p We're no strangers to love
p You know the rules and so do I
p A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
p You wouldn't get this from any other guy
p 
p 
p I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
p Gotta make you understand
p 
p 
p Never gonna give you up
p Never gonna let you down
p Never gonna run around and desert you
p Never gonna make you cry
p Never gonna say goodbye
p Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
p 
p We've known each other for so long
p Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
p Inside, we both know what's been going on
p We know the game, and we're gonna play it
p 
p And if you ask me how I'm feeling
p Don't tell me you're too blind to see
p 
p 
p Never gonna give you up
p Never gonna let you down
p Never gonna run around and desert you
p Never gonna make you cry
p Never gonna say goodbye
p Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
p Never gonna give you up
p Never gonna let you down
p Never gonna run around and desert you
p Never gonna make you cry
p Never gonna say goodbye
p Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
p 
p Ooh (Give you up)
p Ooh-ooh (Give you up)
p Ooh-ooh
p Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)
p Ooh-ooh
p Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)
p 
p We've known each other for so long
p Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
p Inside, we both know what's been going on
p We know the game, and we're gonna play it
p 
p 
p I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
p Gotta make you understand
p 
p Never gonna give you up
p Never gonna let you down
p Never gonna run around and desert you
p Never gonna make you cry
p Never gonna say goodbye
p Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
p Never gonna give you up
p Never gonna let you down
p Never gonna run around and desert you
p Never gonna make you cry
p Never gonna say goodbye
p Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
p Never gonna give you up
p Never gonna let you down
p Never gonna run around and desert you
p Never gonna make you cry
p Never gonna say goodbye
p Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
